# Monitor your generative AI application

This exercise takes approximately **30 minutes**.

> **Note**: This exercise assumes some familiarity with Azure AI Foundry, which is why some instructions are intentionally less detailed to encourage more active exploration and hands-on learning.

## Introduction

In this exercise, you enable monitoring for a chat completion app and view its performance in Azure Monitor. You interact with your deployed model to generate data, view the generated data through the Insights for Generative AI applications dashboard, and set up alerts to help optimize the model's deployment.

## Set up the environment

To complete the tasks in this exercise, you need:

- An Azure AI Foundry project,
- A deployed model (like GPT-4o),
- A connected Application Insights resource.

### Deploy a model in an Azure AI Foundry project

To quickly setup an Azure AI Foundry project, simple instructions to use the Azure AI Foundry portal UI are provided below.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials.
1. In the home page, in the **Explore models and capabilities** section, search for the `gpt-4o` model; which we'll use in our project.
1. In the search results, select the **gpt-4o** model to see its details, and then at the top of the page for the model, select **Use this model**.
1. When prompted to create a project, enter a valid name for your project and expand **Advanced options**.
1. Select **Customize** and specify the following settings for your project:
    - **Azure AI Foundry resource**: *A valid name for your Azure AI Foundry resource*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Create or select a resource group*
    - **Region**: *Select any **AI Services supported location***\*

    > \* Some Azure AI resources are constrained by regional model quotas. In the event of a quota limit being exceeded later in the exercise, there's a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region.

1. Select **Create** and wait for your project, including the gpt-4 model deployment you selected, to be created.
1. In the navigation pane on the left, select **Overview** to see the main page for your project.
1. In the **Endpoints and keys** area, ensure that the **Azure AI Foundry** library is selected and view the **Azure AI Foundry project endpoint**.
1. **Save** the endpoint in a notepad. You'll use this endpoint to connect to your project in a client application.

### Connect Application Insights

Connect Application Insights to your project in Azure AI Foundry to start collecting data for monitoring.

1. Use the menu on the left, and select the **Tracing** page.
1. **Create a new** Application Insights resource to connect to your app.
1. Enter an Application Insights resource name and select **Create**.

Application Insights is now connected to your project, and data will begin to be collected for analysis.

## Interact with a deployed model

You'll interact with your deployed model programmatically by setting up a connection to your Azure AI Foundry project using Azure Cloud Shell. This will allow you to send a prompt to the model and generate monitoring data.

### Connect with a model through the Cloud Shell

Start by retrieving the necessary information to be authenticated to interact with your model. Then, you'll access the Azure Cloud Shell and update the configuration to send the provided prompts to your own deployed model.

1. Open a new browser tab (keeping the Azure AI Foundry portal open in the existing tab).
1. In the new tab, browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`; signing in with your Azure credentials if prompted.
1. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment with no storage in your subscription.
1. In the Cloud Shell toolbar, in the **Settings** menu, select **Go to Classic version**.

    **<font color="red">Ensure you've switched to the Classic version of the Cloud Shell before continuing.</font>**

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, enter and run the following commands:

    ```
    rm -r mslearn-genaiops -f
    git clone https://github.com/microsoftlearning/mslearn-genaiops mslearn-genaiops
    ```

    This command clones the GitHub repository containing the code files for this exercise.

    > **Tip**: As you paste commands into the cloudshell, the output may take up a large amount of the screen buffer. You can clear the screen by entering the `cls` command to make it easier to focus on each task.

1. After the repo has been cloned, navigate to the folder containing the application code files:  

    ```
   cd mslearn-genaiops/Files/07
    ```

1. In the Cloud Shell command-line pane, enter the following command to install the libraries you need:

    ```
   python -m venv labenv
   ./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
   pip install python-dotenv openai azure-identity azure-ai-projects opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai-v2 azure-monitor-opentelemetry
    ```

1. Enter the following command to open the configuration file that has been provided:

    ```
   code .env
    ```

    The file is opened in a code editor.

1. In the code file:

    1. In the code file, replace the **your_project_endpoint** placeholder with the endpoint for your project (copied from the project **Overview** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal).
    1. Replace the **your_model_deployment** placeholder with the name you assigned to your GPT-4o model deployment (by default `gpt-4o`).

1. *After* you've replaced the placeholders, in the code editor, use the **CTRL+S** command or **Right-click > Save** to **save your changes** and then use the **CTRL+Q** command or **Right-click > Quit** to close the code editor while keeping the cloud shell command line open.

### Send prompts to your deployed model

You'll now run multiple scripts that send different prompts to your deployed model. These interactions generate data that you can later observe in Azure Monitor.

1. Run the following command to **view the first script** that has been provided:

    ```
   code start-prompt.py
    ```

1. In the cloud shell command-line pane, enter the following command to sign into Azure.

    ```
   az login
    ```

    **<font color="red">You must sign into Azure - even though the cloud shell session is already authenticated.</font>**

    > **Note**: In most scenarios, just using *az login* will be sufficient. However, if you have subscriptions in multiple tenants, you may need to specify the tenant by using the *--tenant* parameter. See [Sign into Azure interactively using the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively) for details.
    
1. When prompted, follow the instructions to open the sign-in page in a new tab and enter the authentication code provided and your Azure credentials. Then complete the sign in process in the command line, selecting the subscription containing your Azure AI Foundry hub if prompted.
1. After you have signed in, enter the following command to run the application:

    ```
   python start-prompt.py
    ```

    The model will generate a response, which will be captured with Application Insights for further analysis. Let's vary our prompts to explore their effects.

1. **Open and review the script**, where the prompt instructs the model to **only answer with one sentence and a list**:

    ```
   code short-prompt.py
    ```

1. **Run the script** by entering the following command in the command-line:

    ```
   python short-prompt.py
    ```

1. The next script has a similar objective, but includes the instructions for the output in the **system message** instead of the user message:

    ```
   code system-prompt.py
    ```

1. **Run the script** by entering the following command in the command-line:

    ```
   python system-prompt.py
    ```

1. Finally, let's try to trigger an error by running a prompt with **too many tokens**:

    ```
   code error-prompt.py
    ```

1. **Run the script** by entering the following command in the command-line. Note that you're very **likely to experience an error!**

    ```
   python error-prompt.py
    ```

Now that you have interacted with the model, you can review the data in Azure Monitor.

> **Note**: It may take a few minutes for monitoring data to show in Azure Monitor.

## View monitoring data in Azure Monitor

To view data collected from your model interactions, you'll access the dashboard that links to a workbook in Azure Monitor.

### Navigate to Azure Monitor from the Azure AI Foundry portal

1. Navigate to the tab in your browser with the **Azure AI Foundry portal** open.
1. Use the menu on the left, select **Monitoring**.
1. Select the **Resource usage** and review the summarized data of the interactions with your deployed model.

> **Note**: You can also select **Azure Monitor metrics explorer** at the bottom of the Monitoring page for a complete view of all available metrics. The link will open Azure Monitor in a new tab.

## Interpret monitoring metrics

Now it's time to dig into the data and begin interpreting what it tells you.

### Review the token usage

Focus on the **token usage** section first and review the following metrics:

- **Total requests**: The number of separate inference requests, which is how many times the model was called.

> Useful for analyzing throughput and understanding average cost per call.

- **Total token count**: The combined total prompt tokens and completion tokens.

> Most important metric for billing and performance, as it drives latency and cost.

- **Prompt token count**: The total number of tokens used in the input (the prompts you sent) across all model calls.

> Think of this as the *cost of asking* the model a question.

- **Completion token count**: The number of tokens the model returned as output, essentially the length of the responses.

> The generated completion tokens often represent the bulk of token usage and cost, especially for long or verbose answers.

### Compare the individual prompts

1. Use the menu on the left, select **Tracing**. Expand each **generate_completion** gen AI span to see their child spans. Each prompt is represented as a new row of data. Review and compare the contents of the following columns:

- **Input**: Displays the user message that was sent to the model.

> Use this column to assess which prompt formulations are efficient or problematic.

- **Output**: Contains the model's response.

> Use it to assess verbosity, relevance, and consistency. Especially in relation to token counts and duration.

- **Duration**: Shows how long the model took to respond, in milliseconds.

> Compare across rows to explore which prompt patterns result in longer processing times.

- **Success**: Whether a model call succeeded or failed.

> Use this to identify problematic prompts or configuration errors. The last prompt likely failed because the prompt was too long.

## (OPTIONAL) Create an alert

If you have extra time, try setting up an alert to notify you when model latency exceeds a certain threshold. This is an exercise designed to challenge you, which means instructions are intentionally less detailed.

- In Azure Monitor, create a **new alert rule** for your Azure AI Foundry project and model.
- Choose a metric such as **Request duration (ms)** and define a threshold (for example, greater than 4000 ms).
- Create a **new action group** to define how you'll be notified.

Alerts help you prepare for production by establishing proactive monitoring. The alerts you configure will depend on your project's priorities and how your team has decided to measure and mitigate risks.
